# 🫁 Miliary TB Detection using Chest X-ray (Deep Learning)

This project is a Deep Learning based **medical image classification** system that predicts whether a chest X-ray image indicates **Miliary Tuberculosis (Miliary TB)** or **Normal**.

It uses a CNN-based model trained using **TensorFlow/Keras**, and includes a simple interactive UI using **Gradio** for easy testing and demo.

## ✅ Project Highlights
- Deep Learning model for **binary classification**: Normal vs Miliary TB
- End-to-end pipeline:
  - Image preprocessing (resize, normalization)
  - Model training
  - Evaluation
  - Deployment-ready Gradio web app
- Easy to run locally

## 📌 Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NumPy**
- **OpenCV / PIL**
- **Gradio**
- **Matplotlib (optional for visualization)**

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Miliary TB is a serious form of tuberculosis that can be difficult to detect early using traditional methods.  
This project helps support faster screening by classifying chest X-rays into:
- ✅ Normal
- ❌ Miliary TB
